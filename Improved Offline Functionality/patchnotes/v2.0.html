<h2>Improved Offline Functionality v2.0 - Patch Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reworked achievement state saving.</li>
<ul>
<li>IOF will now check if achievements were successfully loaded from Steam before saving the achievement state.</li>
<li>IOF will now save all achievements, including any achievements added in the future.</li>
</ul>
<li>Added new "Freeze Achievement State" option to prevent achievements from ever being removed. Disabled by default.</li>
<ul>
<li>The new achievement checks should, in principle, be sufficient to prevent the "Outfit Locked" bug. However, if you are still getting this bug, you can enable this option.</li>
</ul>
<li>Added new "Delete Local State File" button for deleting locally saved achievement state.</i>
<ul>
<li>Enabling the "Freeze Achievement State" option will prevent your locally saved achievements from ever being removed. Therefore, if you choose to reset your Steam achievements at any point, you will need to manually delete your local state file using this button.</li>
</ul>
<li>Reworked Captain Winters check to improve stability/compatibility.</li>
<li>Reworked interaction interrupt check to improve stability/compatibility.</li>
<li>Reworked offline chat to improve stability/compatibility.</li>
</ul>
